# Project-1

## First Project; Horiseon Website

I took on this project as my first major step in becoming a software engineer since my bootcamp pre-work. The HTML and CSS were largely in place, and I just added symantic elements, accessability, and a few other elements to the HTML to help clean up the coding. At one point I broke the CSS for the links in the header, but it was fun to debugg that. It also reinforced the knowledge that the symantic elements need to be inside the class attribute.
